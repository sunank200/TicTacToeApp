## AI Logic (Minimax Algorithm)
The Single Player mode uses a Minimax algorithm to play optimally:
1. **Minimax Search**: Recursively explore all possible moves
2. **Scoring**:
   - AI win: **+10 âˆ’ depth**
   - Human win: **depth âˆ’ 10**
   - Draw: **0**
3. **Choice**: AI selects the move with the highest score, ensuring it never loses.
